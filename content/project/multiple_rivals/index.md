What rival relationship matters in domestic politics? Some scholars show that
leaders who cooperate with a rival country are more likely to be removed (e.g., Colaresi 2004). Although they examine the effects of policy choices (conflict v. cooperation) and policy outcomes (success v. failure) on leadership tenure in the context of rivalry, they rarely discuss the countries facing multiple rival relationships. When a country has multiple rivals, the effects of conflictual/cooperative policies and their outcomes can vary depending on the characteristics of rival relationships. This article focuses on how the public approves of its leaderâ€™s cooperative or conflictual foreign policies toward a rival country depending on the characteristics of rivals. For analysis, online survey experiments in Japan and South Korea are employed.
