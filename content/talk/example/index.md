key words: International Conflict, Rivalry, Networks
abstract: "In this paper, I focus on international rivalries as a negative tie network and apply network concepts to models, particularly, centralities and triangles. Specifically, centrality can provide information about how vulnerable one state is in the rivalry network. On the other hand, one state within a rivalry triangle which consists of three rivalry relationships, can change its relationship with one of its rivals because the imbalanced triangle is not strategically beneficial for it. I employ the Cox duration models including negative centrality and triangle terms, and compare the results."
