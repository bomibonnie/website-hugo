I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Arkansas. I was part of a National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded research program on [Women as Leaders, Policy-Makers, and Symbols](https://tiffanydbarnes.weebly.com/research.html). I received my BA in political science, MA in international relations from Seoul National University, and PhD in Political Science from the University of Iowa. My research focuses on international conflict. In my dissertation, *Interconnected Rivalries*, I examine the interdependence among interstate rivalries by focusing on triangular relationships and centrality in rivalry networks. I also have ongoing co-authored projects on climate change and interstate conflict.
