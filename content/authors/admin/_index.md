I am a post-doctoral scholar at the Department of Political Science at the University of Kentucky. I am part of an National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded research program on [Women as Leaders, Policy-Makers, and Symbols](https://tiffanydbarnes.weebly.com/research.html). I received my BA in political science, MA in international relations from Seoul National University, and PhD in Political Science from the University of Iowa. My research focuses on interconnectedness of amity and enmity in international relations. In my dissertation, *Interconnected Rivalries*, I examine the interdependence among interstate rivalries by focusing on triangularities and centralities in rivalry networks. I also have ongoing co-authored projects on climate change and interstate conflict.
